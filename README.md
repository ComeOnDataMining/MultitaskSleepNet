These are source code and experimental setup used in our above arXiv preprint. Although the networks have many things in common, we try to separate them and make them work independently to ease exploring them invididually.

Currently the source code and experimental setup for __SleepEDF Expanded database__ are available. We are preparing for __MASS dataset database__ and will update them very shortly.
